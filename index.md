### Virtual Drug Screening
I currently work with [Dr. Eagon](https://web.calpoly.edu/~seagon/), a chemistry professor at Cal Poly, to virtually screen small molecules for activity against various protein targets.

Ongoing Projects:
- Targeting the [SARS-CoV-2 protease](https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/Crystal-structures-novel-coronavirus-protease/98/web/2020/03)
- Targeting Plasmodium falciparum's, the parasite that causes malaria, [falciylsin protein](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12876284/)
- Targeting a [rabies glycoprotein](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6tou)

We use the molecular docking programs [iDock](https://github.com/HongjianLi/idock) and smina to evaluate the free energy of ligand protein complexes of 7.5 million small molecules from the [ZINC15](http://zinc15.docking.org/) database. The work is distributed across machines at Cal Poly using a [custom program that I wrote](https://github.com/mcclane/distributed-docking). My current record is screening our library of 7.5 million compounds in a week, using only resources at Cal Poly.

### Machine Learning
Applying [neural graph machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04818) to the METABRIC breast cancer dataset to find relationships between patient metadata and subtypes of breast cancer.
